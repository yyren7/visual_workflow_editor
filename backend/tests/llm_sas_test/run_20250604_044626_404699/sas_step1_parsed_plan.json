        "section_title": "III. Modularization and Reuse Explanation",
        "content": "*   **Clamp Operations**: `Open/Close_BH_Crump` and `Open/Close_BRG&PLT_Crump` are designed as independent, reusable sub-programs. They encapsulate the specific control logic for each clamp type and are called by various material handling sub-programs (`BRG_Get_BRG`, `Get_BH_InitialPos`, `RMC_Put_BH&BRG`, etc.). This promotes consistency and simplifies maintenance.\n*   **Standard Movement Sequences**: Most pick and place sub-programs (`BRG_Get_BRG`, `Get_BH_InitialPos`, `CNV_Get_PLT`, etc.) follow a common \"approach target -> precise positioning -> execute action (grasp/release) -> depart target -> return to safe position\" movement pattern. This logic can be abstracted and reused, potentially through parameterized functions for different target locations.\n*   **Speed Control**: For operations requiring high precision or delicate handling (e.g., `RMC_Put_BH&BRG`, `CNV_Get_PLT`), the core logic explicitly mentions the need for reduced speed during critical phases. This can be implemented via a parameter or a dedicated low-speed movement function.\n*   **External Interaction and Synchronization**: The main process incorporates multiple points for synchronization with external devices (RMC, LMC, conveyor). This is achieved by waiting for specific input signals (`RMC_Ready_IN`, `RMC_Done_IN`) and sending output signals (`RMC_PartTaken_OUT`, `Task_Complete_OUT`). This modular approach ensures robust interaction with the surrounding environment.\n*   **Optional Logic**: Features like waiting for an external start signal or sending a task complete signal are marked as optional. This allows for flexible deployment, where these features can be enabled or disabled based on the specific system integration requirements without altering the core process flow."
