The `data` field is a dictionary containing node-specific properties.  Global variables are stored as a JSON object and can be accessed within node logic using their names. JWT tokens are used for authentication and session management.","Anything UNCLEAR":"The exact structure of the `node_data` returned by the `/llm/generate_node` API needs to be precisely defined to ensure seamless integration with Reactflow. The mapping between natural language descriptions of node properties and the corresponding Reactflow node data structure needs clarification. Also, the specific LLM API being used (e.g., OpenAI) and its authentication method should be explicitly stated."}
